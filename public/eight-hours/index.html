  Eight Hours

<!--<p class="subtitle"><strong>2025-06-03</strong></p> -->
<p>I'm reading <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/600671/how-to-do-nothing-by-jenny-odell/">How to Do
Nothing</a>
by Jenny Odell. It has lots to like, like this song from the Federation of
Organized Trades and Labor Unions:</p>
<em>
<p>We mean to make things over;<br />
we're tired of toil for naught<br />
but bare enough to live on:<br />
never an hour for thought.</p>
<p>We want to feel the sunshine;<br />
we want to smell the flowers;<br />
We're sure that God has willed it,<br />
and we mean to have eight hours.</p>
<p>We're summoning our forces<br />
from shipyard, shop and mill:<br />
Eight hours for work, eight hours for rest,<br />
eight hours for what we will!</p>
</em>
