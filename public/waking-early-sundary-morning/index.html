  Waking Early Sunday Morning
</h1>
<!--<p class="subtitle"><strong>2025-07-04</strong></p> -->
<p>Oh to break loose, like the chinook<br />
salmon jumping and falling back,<br />
nosing up to the impossible<br />
stone and bone-crushing waterfall—<br />
raw-jawed, weak fleshed there, stopped by ten<br />
steps of the roaring ladder, and then<br />
to clear the top on the last try,<br />
alive enough to spawn and die.</p>
<p>Stop, back off. The salmon breaks<br />
water, and now my body wakes<br />
to feel the unpolluted joy<br />
and criminal leisure of a boy—<br />
no rainbow smashing a dry fly<br />
in the white run is free as I,<br />
here squatting like a dragon on<br />
time’s hoard before the day’s begun!</p>
<p>Time to grub up and junk the year’s<br />
output, a dead wood of dry verse:<br />
dim confession, coy revelation,<br />
liftings, listless self-imitation,<br />
whole days when I could hardly speak,<br />
came pluming home unshaven, weak<br />
and willing to read anyone<br />
things done before and better done.</p>
<p>Fierce, fireless mind, running down hill.<br />
Look up and see the harbor fill:<br />
business as usual in eclipse<br />
goes down to the sea in ships—<br />
wake of refuse, dacron rope,<br />
bound for Bermuda or Good Hope,<br />
all bright before the morning watch,<br />
the wine dark hulls of yawl and ketch.</p>
<p>I watch a glass of water wet<br />
with a fine fuzz of icy sweat,<br />
silvery colors touched with sky,<br />
serene in their neutrality—<br />
yet if I shift, or change my mood,<br />
I see some object made of wood,<br />
background behind it of brown grain,<br />
to darken it, but not to stain.</p>
<p>Oh that the spirit could remain<br />
tinged but untarnished by its strain!<br />
Better dressed and stacking birch,<br />
or lost with the Faithful at Church—<br />
Oh anywhere, but somewhere else!<br />
And now the new electric bells,<br />
clearly chiming, “Faith of our fathers,”<br />
and now the congregation gathers.</p>
<p>Oh Bible chopped and crucified<br />
in hymns we hear but do not read,<br />
none of the milder subtleties<br />
of grace or art will sweeten these<br />
stiff quatrains shovelled out four-square—<br />
they sing of peace, and preach despair;<br />
yet they gave darkness their control,<br />
and left a loophole for the soul.</p>
<p>No, put old clothes on, and explore<br />
the corners of the woodshed for<br />
its dregs and dreck: tools with no handle,<br />
ten candle-ends not worth a candle,<br />
old lumber banished from the Temple,<br />
damned by Paul’s precept and example,<br />
cast from the kingdom, banned in Israel,<br />
the wordless sign, the tinkling cymbal.</p>
<p>Empty, irresolute, ashamed,<br />
when the sacred texts are named,<br />
I lie here on my bed apart,<br />
and when I look into my heart,<br />
I discover none of the great<br />
subjects: death, friendship, love and hate—<br />
only old china doorknobs, sad,<br />
slight, useless things to calm the mad.</p>
<p>Oh to break loose now. All life’s grandeur<br />
is something with a girl in summer…<br />
elated as the President<br />
girdled by his establishment<br />
this Sunday morning, free to chaff<br />
his own thoughts with his bear-cuffed staff,<br />
swimming nude, unbuttoned, sick<br />
of his ghost-written rhetoric!</p>
<p>No weekends for the gods now, Wars<br />
flicker, earth licks its open sores,<br />
fresh breakage, fresh promotions, chance<br />
assassinations, no advance.<br />
Only man thinning out his kind<br />
sounds through the Sabbath noon, the blind<br />
swipe of the pruner and his knife<br />
busy about the tree of life.</p>
<p>Oh hammering military splendor,<br />
top-heavy Goliath in full armor—<br />
little redemption in the mass<br />
liquidations of their brass,<br />
elephant and phalanx moving<br />
with the times and still improving,<br />
when that kingdom hit the crash:<br />
a million foreskins stacked like trash…</p>
<p>Sing softer! But what if the new<br />
diminuendo brings no true<br />
tenderness, only restlessness,<br />
excess, the hunger for success,<br />
sanity of self-deception<br />
fixed and kicked by reckless caution,<br />
while I listen to the bells—<br />
Oh anywhere, but somewhere else!</p>
<p>Pity the planet, all joy gone<br />
from this sweet volcanic cone;<br />
peace to our children when they fall<br />
in small war on the heels of small<br />
war—until the end of time<br />
to police the earth, a ghost<br />
orbiting forever lost<br />
in our monotonous sublime.<br />
