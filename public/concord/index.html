<p>by Robert Lowell</p>
<p>Ten thousand Fords are idle here in search<br />
Of a tradition. Over these dry sticks—<br />
The Minute Man, the Irish Catholics,<br />
The ruined bridge and Walden’s fished-out perch<br />
The belfry of the Unitarian Church<br />
Rings out the hanging Jesus. Crucifix,<br />
How can your whited spindling arms transfix<br />
Mammon’s unbridled industry, the lurch<br />
For forms to harness Heraclitus’ stream!<br />
This Church is Concord—Concord where Thoreau<br />
Named all the birds without a gun to probe<br />
Through darkness to the painted man and bow:<br />
The death-dance of King Philip and his scream<br />
Whose echo girdled this imperfect globe.</p>
