<p>You could say this poem by Elizabeth Bishop motivates this website.</p>
<p>Alone on the railroad track<br />
I walked with pounding heart.<br />
The ties were too close together<br />
or maybe too far apart.<br />
The scenery was impoverished:<br />
scrub-pine and oak; beyond<br />
its mingled gray-green foliage<br />
I saw the little pond<br />
where the dirty old hermit lives,<br />
lie like an old tear<br />
holding onto its injuries<br />
lucidly year after year.<br />
The hermit shot off his shot-gun<br />
and the tree by his cabin shook.<br />
Over the pond went a ripple<br />
The pet hen went chook-chook.<br />
"Love should be put into action!"<br />
screamed the old hermit.<br />
Across the pond an echo<br />
tried and tried to confirm it.</p>
