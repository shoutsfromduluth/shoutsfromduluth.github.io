  The Line-Gang
</h1>
<!--<p class="subtitle"><strong>2025-06-22</strong></p> -->
<p>Here come the line-gang pioneering by.<br />
They throw a forest down less cut than broken.<br />
They plant dead trees for living, and the dead<br />
They string together with a living thread.<br />
They string an instrument against the sky<br />
Wherein words whether beaten out or spoken<br />
Will run as hushed as when they were a thought<br />
But in no hush they string it: they go past<br />
With shouts afar to pull the cable taut,<br />
To hold it hard until they make it fast,<br />
To ease awayâ€”they have it. With a laugh,<br />
An oath of towns that set the wild at naught<br />
They bring the telephone and telegraph.<br />

<p>[<em>On my bike rides outside of Duluth I pass the fiberoptic line gangs bringing
gigabits to the rural roads. What was life in rural areas like before the
telephone? Curmudgeonly Frost seems to think it much better. I'm not sure.</em>]</p>
