  Bitter-Sweet
</h1>
<!--<p class="subtitle"><strong>2025-06-07</strong></p> -->
<p>By George Herbert</p>
<p>Ah, my dear angry Lord,<br />
Since thou dost love, yet strike;<br />
Cast down, yet help afford;<br />
Sure I will do the like.</p>
<p>I will complain, yet praise;<br />
I will bewail, approve;<br />
And all my sour-sweet days<br />
I will lament and love.</p>
<hr />
<p>From Ezra Klein's podcast with Mark Epstein:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In that book, I quoted the poet Anne Carson, who has a beautiful book called
“Eros the Bittersweet,” where she quotes Sappho. Carson is a scholar of
ancient Greek, and she says the Greek word for “bittersweet” is actually
“sweetbitter,” that it’s turned around in English. The sweetness comes first,
but then, because there’s always a little bit of a letdown, that’s where the
bitterness is.</p>
<p>The Buddha, in his teachings, was actually saying that gap is interesting.
And that, if instead of turning away or getting angry or getting frustrated
or trying to squeeze more out of the object of desire, if instead we can
settle our minds into that gap with less judgment, there’s an important
lesson there that will help us with old age, illness, death and any other
tragedies that are going to befall us.</p>
