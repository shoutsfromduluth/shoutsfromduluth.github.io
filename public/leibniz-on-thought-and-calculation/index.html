  Leibniz on Thought and Mere Calculation
</h1>
<!--<p class="subtitle"><strong>2025-07-12</strong></p> -->
<p>From Justin E. H. Smith's <em>The Internet Is Not What You Think It Is</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Leibniz, for his part, was operating under no such illusions as to the nature
of the machine he was seeking to build. In a 1685 text entitled "An
Arithmetical Machine in which Not Only Addition and Subtraction But Also
Multiplication and Division Are Carried Out with Virtually No Effort of the
Mind," Leibniz plainly envisions his device not as something that will think,
or that will involve the labor of an artificial mind rather than of a natural
one. On the contrary, the machine will free the human mind so it may devote
itself more fully to true and proper thinking—which is to say reflection,
meditation, introspection, and the like—rather than being occupied with mere
computation, which the mind can do too, but which may also be done by systems
that are not minds. Leibniz explains the benefit of such outsourcing: "[I]t
is unworthy of excellent men to lose hours like slaves in the labor of
calculation, which could be safely relegated to anyone else if the machine
were used."</p>
<p>Thinking for Leibniz is the hallmark of human excellence, while mere
calculating is an obstacle to human excellence: from these two claims
together, it follows that calculating is not thinking; or, again to put it in
Cantwell Smith's terms, reckoning is not judgment; or, finally, to put it in
my own preferred terms, artificial intelligence is only intelligence <em>in a
metaphorical sense</em>, where a term is being carried over from one domain into
another in which it does not naturally belong, in order, so we think, to help
use make sense of what we are observing there. What we are really doing, of
course, is seeking to make sense of one thing that is poorly understood in
terms carried over from something that is even more poorly understood. We at
least have what rancis Bacon would call "maker's knowledge" of AI systems: we
built them, and therefore in an important sense we know them inside and out,
as fully as one can know them. We do not have maker's knowledge of human
minds, which is another way of saying we have not yet created artifical
intelligence in a true and proper, non-metaphorical sense: we have never
built an actual brain, even if we have become pretty good at modeling brains,
and simulating at least some of what brains do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I imagine Leibniz, wracking his brain with calculation, speaks out of desire
for relief (for narcosis, as McLuhan might say), and might have something
different to say if he were given a Texas Instruments calculator from three
hundred years in the future. Would he ever say "You know, I might prefer to
calculate this myself?" Surely he'd get there when faced with tomorrow's AI,
which would take too much of the thinking from him. Smith may say the AI isn't
thinking, and I agree here, but of course it enables the offloading of more and
more thinking. How carefully and jealously does excellent man guard his
thinking?</p>
<p>I suppose I might agree with what Leibniz wrote here when thinking about my own
relationship with mathematics: It's been aided by calculators and symbolic
algebra software the entire way. I'd rather offload simple arithmetic, and I
can't do anything but the most basic integration for the life of me. At
different times I've wanted to be able to remember random integration rules and
tricks. No longer, thankfully.</p>
