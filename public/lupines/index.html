  Lupines

<!--<p class="subtitle"><strong>2025-06-02</strong></p> -->
<p>Lupines, big-leafed lupine, <em>Lupinus polyphyllus</em>, supposedly pronounced
"LEW-pin" but everyone I know says "LEW-pine".
<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/lupin#English">Apparently</a> named for a
fang-like structure in the inner flower but I had heard that they were
previously used to poison wolves.</p>
<p>I've <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupinus_polyphyllus">just learned</a> that the
lupines of Minnesota's North Shore are invasive. Having recently moved here
from the West where <em>Lupinus</em> is native and diverse, I was happy to see the big
purple and pink masts in the ditches and puzzled over why they should exist out
west and here but nowhere in between. Now I know that they were brought here as
ornamentals and escaped into the margins.</p>
<p>Around Duluth I've not heard anyone talk of eradication, only appreciation.
We'll be transplanting some into our gardens this summer.</p>
<p>On a ride the other day I snapped this photo, the first lupines of the year.</p>
