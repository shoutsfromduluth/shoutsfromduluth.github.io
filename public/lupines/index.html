  Lupines

<!--<p class="subtitle"><strong>2025-06-02</strong></p> -->
<p>Lupines, big-leafed lupine, <em>Lupinus polyphyllus</em>, supposedly pronounced
"LEW-pin" but everyone I know says "LEW-pine".
<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/lupin#English">Apparently</a> named for a
fang-like structure in the inner flower. I think I read that they were once
used to poison wolves.</p>
<p>I've <a href="https://www.minnesotawildflowers.info/flower/large-leaved-lupine">just
learned</a> that
the lupines of Minnesota's north shore are invasive. ("ERADICATE!") Having
recently moved here from the western U.S. where <em>Lupinus</em> is native and
diverse, I was happy to see the big purple and pink masts in the ditches and
puzzled over why they should exist out west and here but nowhere in between.
Now I know that they were brought here as ornamentals and escaped into the
margins.</p>
<p>Around Duluth I've not heard anyone talk of eradication, only appreciation.
We'll be planting some in our garden this year.</p>
<p>On a ride the other day I snapped this photo, the first lupine of the year.</p>

<p>I'll keep my eye out for <em>Lupinus perennis</em>, the local native lupine.</p>
