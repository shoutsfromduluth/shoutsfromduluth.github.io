  A Cold Spring / The Spring-ometer
</h1>
<!--<p class="subtitle"><strong>2025-06-01</strong></p> -->
<p>By Elizabeth Bishop</p>
<p>A cold spring:<br />
the violet was flawed on the lawn.<br />
For two weeks or more the trees hesitated;<br />
the little leaves waited,<br />
carefully indicating their characteristics.<br />
Finally a grave green dust<br />
settled over your big and aimless hills.<br />
One day, in a chill white blast of sunshine,<br />
on the side of one a calf was born.<br />
The mother stopped lowing<br />
and took a long time eating the after-birth,<br />
a wretched flag,<br />
but the calf got up promptly<br />
and seemed inclined to feel gay.</p>
<p>The next day<br />
was much warmer.<br />
Greenish-white dogwood infiltrated the wood,<br />
each petal burned, apparently, by a cigarette-butt;<br />
and the blurred redbud stood<br />
beside it, motionless, but almost more<br />
like movement than any placeable color.<br />
Four deer practised leaping over your fences.<br />
The infant oak-leaves swung through the sober oak.<br />
Song-sparrows were wound up for the summer,<br />
and in the maple the complementary cardinal<br />
cracked a whip, and the sleeper awoke,<br />
stretching miles of green limbs from the south.<br />
In his cap the lilacs whitened,<br />
then one day they fell like snow.  <span style="color: #ff0000">← YOU ARE HERE.</span></p>
<p>Now, in the evening,<br />
a new moon comes.<br />
The hills grow softer. Tufts of long grass show<br />
where each cow-flop lies.<br />
The bull-frogs are sounding,<br />
slack strings plucked by heavy thumbs.<br />
Beneath the light, against your white front door,<br />
the smallest moths, like Chinese fans,<br />
flatten themselves, silver and silver-gilt<br />
over pale yellow, orange, or gray.<br />
Now, from the thick grass, the fireflies<br />
begin to rise:<br />
up, then down, then up again:<br />
lit on the ascending flight,<br />
drifting simultaneously to the same height,<br />
–exactly like the bubbles in champagne.<br />
–Later on they rise much higher.<br />
And your shadowy pastures will be able to offer<br />
these particular glowing tributes<br />
every evening now throughout the summer.</p>
