  *Rubus parviflorus*

<!--<p class="subtitle"><strong>2025-06-17</strong></p> -->
<p>Besides being happy to find lupines in Duluth, upon moving here we were also
happy to find thimbleberries, which we found to be great trail snacks out west.
The Latin name is <em>Rubus parviflorus</em>, which has stuck with me because <em>parvi-</em>
means poor or impoverished, and this bramble has one of the largest flowers in
the <em>Rubus</em> genus. Today I thought to look into why this is.</p>
<p><em>Rubus parviflorus</em> was named by Thomas Nuttal from a sample taken from Mackinac
Island in 1810. See the screenshots from his <a href="https://archive.org/details/mobot31753002739768/page/309/mode/2up"><em>The genera of North American
plants, and a catalogue of the species, to the year
1817</em></a>
below.</p>

<p>Sure enough, he says "flowers small." Okay.</p>
<p>Except <a href="https://www.swcoloradowildflowers.com/White%20Enlarged%20Photo%20Pages/rubus.htm">other
sources</a>
claim that it was actually Meriwether Lewis that first collected the species
for botanical description in 1806, and that <em>Rubus parviflorus</em> was already
taken for a European <em>Rubus</em> species in 1770, so it's actually Jose Moci√±o that
gets to name it <em>Rubus nutkanus</em>, after Nootka Island in Vancouver where he
collected it on a Spanish botanical expedition. But then see this note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: When I checked the authoritative Flora of North America in December of
2021, it had <em>Rubus nutkanus</em> as the accepted name for the species shown here.
I emailed botanists at the FNA regarding some small irregularities in their
discussion of <em>R. nutkanus</em>, the FNA botanists said they would look into these,
and they also informed me of a proposal made in 2019 to maintain the name of
<em>Rubus parviflorus</em>. I was told that a decision regarding the proposal would be
made in at least a year by a committee of the INTERNATIONAL CODE OF BOTANICAL
NOMENCLATURE. However, a week later the specific epithet on the FNA web page
had been changed from <em>R. nutkanus</em> back to <em>R. parviflorus</em> and the new page
does not mention <em>R. nutkanus</em> at all, not even as a synonym. The result of all
of this is that for some period of time we will find some floras using <em>Rubus
parviflorus</em> and some using <em>Rubus nutkanus</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure enough, the Flora of North America <a href="https://floranorthamerica.org/Rubus_parviflorus">doesn't
mention</a> <em>R. nutkanus</em>
anywhere. I like <em>parviflorus</em> because of the flower size inaccuracy.</p>
<p>The flora says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Great Lakes populations are disjunct from western mountain populations
by around 600 miles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'd like to know more about this biogeography. Why here?</p>
<p>Also, why do they flower and bear fruit some years but not others?</p>
