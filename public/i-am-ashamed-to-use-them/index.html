<p>In Marshall McLuhan's <em>Understanding Media</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Werner Heisenberg, in <em>The Physicist's Conception of Nature</em>, is an example of
the new quantum physicist whose overall awareness of forms suggests to him that
we would do well to stand aside from most of them. He points out that technical
change alters not only habits of life, but patterns of thought and valuation,
citing with approval the outlook of the Chinese sage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As Tzu-Gung was traveling through the regions north of the river Han, he saw an
old man working in his vegetable garden. He had dug an irrigation ditch. The
man would descend into a well, fetch up a vessel of water in his arms and pour
it out into the ditch. While his efforts were tremendous the results appeared
to be very meager.</p>
<p>Tzu-Gung said, "There is a way whereby you can irrigate a hundred ditches in
one day, and whereby you can do much with little effort. Would you not like to
hear of it?"</p>
<p>Then the gardener stood up, looked at him and said, "And what would that be?"
Tsu-Gung replied, "You take a wooden lever, weighted at the back and light in
front. In this way you can bring up water so quickly that it just gushes out.
This is called a draw-well."</p>
<p>Then anger rose up in the old man's face, and he said, "I have heard my teacher
say that whoever uses machines does all his work like a machine. He who does
his work like a machine grows a heart like a machine, and he who carries the
heart of a machine in his breast loses his simplicity. He who has lost his
simplicity becomes unsure in the strivings of his soul. Uncertainty in the
strivings of the soul is something which does not agree with honest sense. It
is not that I do not know of such things; I am ashamed to use them."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps the most interesting point about this anecdote is that it
appeals to a modern physicist.</p>
