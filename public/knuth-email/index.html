  Donald Knuth&#x27;s email

<!--<p class="subtitle"><strong>2026-06-11</strong></p> -->
<p>A <a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/email.html">message</a> from Donald Knuth:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have been a happy man ever since January 1, 1990, when I no longer had an
email address. I'd used email since about 1975, and it seems to me that 15
years of email is plenty for one lifetime.</p>
<p>Email is a wonderful thing for people whose role in life is to be on top of
things. But not for me; my role is to be on the bottom of things.</p>
