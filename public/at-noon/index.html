  At Noon

<p>by Reginald Gibbons</p>
<p>The thick-walled room's cave-darkness,<br />
cool in summer, soothes<br />
by saying, This is the truth, not the taut<br />
cicada-strummed daylight.<br />
Rest here, out of the flame—the thick air's<br />
stirred by the fan's four<br />
slow-moving spoons; under the house the stone<br />
has its feet in deep water.<br />
Outside, even the sun god, dressed in this life<br />
as a lizard, abruptly rises<br />
on stiff legs and descends blasé toward the shadows.</p>
