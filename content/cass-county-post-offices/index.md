My in-laws live in Cass County, Minnesota, and on the drive there from Duluth
my thoughts often turn to the small towns and unincorporated communities miles
off of State Highway 200, which is already a relatively quiet and remote road.
I've never lived in a rural area but am persistently curious about life in
the more remotely rural areas outside of the suburban and urban areas I've
always lived in.

This time this curiousity took me to the Wikipedia
[page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_River,_Minnesota) for Boy River,
Minnesota, which linked to a
[page](https://www.postalhistory.com/postoffices.asp?task=display&state=MN&county=Cass)
on the history of post offices in Cass County. When I saw that there were many
post offices open for only a few years in the late 1800s and early 1900s, I was
taken down a rabbithole exploring the history of Cass County and the United
States Postal Service.

Eventually I found the United States Post Offices
[database](https://cblevins.github.io/us-post-offices/) compiled by Cameron
Blevins and Richard Helbock, which is fascinating in its own right. Subsetting
this dataset to Cass County gave me the locations of the historical Cass County
post offices associated with a location in the USGS Geographic Names Index
System, which is the government's database of official place names.

Of the 74 historical Cass County post offices, 21 were not associated with a
geographic location in the USPO database, so I have spent some time trying to
figure out where these remaining post offices were located. One, Arthur's
Point, operational from 1916 to 1930, was likely located at a resort on the
west wide of Pleasant Lake (or "Lake Pleasant") outside of Hackensack. See
[this
postcard](https://www.ebay.com/itm/324555545525?_trksid=p4375194.c101800.m5481),
and the road that still bears the Arthur's Point name. The post office at
Pokegamon Falls seems to actually have been located in Itasca ("Ver*itas-ca*put")
County near Grand Rapids at [Pokegama
Dam](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/899426#map=19/47.250799/-93.587640)
and is probably included in the Cass County data only due to clerical error.


The post office at Wicklow is described in a [1913
article](http://genealogytrails.com/minn/cass/news_people.html) in the
Kalamazoo Gazette:

> Uncle Sam's smallest post office, at Wicklow, Cass county, faces extinction
> because the seventy-one-year-old post-mistresses insists on retiring. The
> office is situated in a tiny log cabin twelve miles from the nearest railroad
> station, in the midst of a towering jack pine forest. Mrs. Anderson, who
> presides over the destinies of the little office, has been trying to retire
> for two years.
> 
> Mrs. Anderson, despite her age, is still vigorous. Born and reared on a West
> Virginia farm, she was thoroughly conversant with farm life, so when she
> learned that eight aces of thick pine timber was awaiting a homesteader up in
> Cass county she determined to avail herself of her rights as a soldier's widow
> to pre-empt it. So in 1905 she came to the wilds of Minnesota and had built on
> her eighty a little log cabin home.
> 
> APPOINTED POSTMISTRESS.
> Mrs. Anderson had a few neighbors-perhaps half a dozen families within a
> ten-mile radius-and soon after she moved in they came to the conclusion that
> they needed a post office. And who else for the job they asked, than Mrs.
> Anderson? Finally she consented to take it and on January 1, 1909, received her
> commission.
> 
> "I hadn't picked out a spot on the wall to hang my commission before the
> neighbors began to call for mail." says Mrs. Anderson. "People who had not
> received a letter in years and didn’t expect to ever receive one called-just to
> see how the office was prospering. I guess. I had planned my little home for
> myself and my two grandchildren who accompanied me here, but I had to turn my
> best front room into a postoffice. I set up a letter rack here my best rocker
> was to sit alongside the front window, and the mail bags occupy the place I had
> picked out for the lounge. Men came walking through the snow in winter and mud
> in summer and track my front room all up, and between them and Ed-that's my
> grandson-it kept me busy with the broom and dust pan nearly all the time I
> wasn’t about the housework.
> 
> FOURTEEN PATRONS THE LIMIT.
> "The official duties in a big town must be simply awful if my little experience
> is any criterion." continued Mrs. Anderson. "We have three mails a week and I
> have to sort the letters and papers for twelve persons and put them in the
> rural delivery sacks. Two other patrons call at the office for their mail, but
> the red tape connected with it is what causes me to lose sleep, as full and
> regular reports have to be made to the postoffice department as if the office
> were doing $1000 worth of business daily.
> 
> "Of course there is a salary attached to the office-perhaps I should say a
> remuneration. We are allowed a commission on the stamps we cancel and a fee of
> three cents for every money order we issue. You can imagine the volume of
> business we transact out here in the country with fourteen patrons on the list.
> The business for the first quarter of the present year amounted to almost $10
> 
> "I didn't want to take the post office in the first place, but my neighbors
> insisted and two of them volunteered to go on my bond. And now I can't get rid
> of the office. I have sent in my resignation twice, but the government seems
> determined to keep me in office whether or not." 

Wicklow is mentioned as a settlement in other documents, but I can't find
anything that gives a location. I am unreasonably interested in learning the
location.

Other post offices remain elusive. It's possible that the "Minnie" post office
was operated by Minnie Denis of Hackensack, or Minnie Metzer of Longville,
mentioned in newspaper [excerpts](https://casscountymuseum.org/looking-back/)
recorded by the Cass County Historical Society.

I like driving, and when I'm driving I like to think about place name history.
This post office diversion has scratched that itch of mine, and at the same
time I've learned more about the history of the part of north-central Minnesota
that's most important to me. And I'm glad I now know about the Geographic Names
Information System. My original intention in gathering the post office
locations was to produce a map of current and former post offices, and I may
yet make that map, but for now I'd simply like to get the locations of some of
these ephemeral post offices. I've sent an email to the Cass County Historical
Society and will post an update if I learn anything more.

Update:

The Cass County Historical Society got back to me and pointed me to Rhonda
Fochs's *[Lost Towns of Minnesota: Northern
Edition](https://www.northstarpress.com/store/p64/_Minnesota%27s_Lost_Towns%3A_Northern_Edition.html)*,
which I picked up at my local library. The section on Cass County had one of my
missing towns, and much to my surprise it was located right next to where my
in-laws have their original family cabin on Ten Mile Lake. Lathrop, Minnesota
is completly invisible at this point as far as I know, although the next time I
drive past the spot I will look carefully. Here is an excerpt of the story of
Lothrop:

> Long before the 112-mile hiking and biking trail was ever envisioned, the
> railroad laid their double steel rails along the now paved route. Once the
> end of the line, Lothrop was platted in 1895 and named for a civil engineer
> and surveyor. Typical for railroad and logging towns of that era, Lothrop was
> a wild, rowdy end-of-the-line location. With nearly 2,000 lumberjacks and
> railroad men in the area, Lothrop became the place of choice for spending the
> reported $100,000 paid in wages during the winter of 1895-1896. There were
> also family residents as the local newspaper reported on school Christmas
> programs. One account lists twenty-four family residences.
> 
> The town included a roundhouse, post office (1894 to 1901), several stores
> including a butcher shop, a bakery, a drug store, two general stores, two
> barber shops, three or four restaurants, a red-light district, and at least
> seven saloons. Mary Norton, a longtime resident and local historian, recalls
> that the red-light district had as many houses as there were taverns. Each had
> their own private place of business. Mary also recalled that the town of 1,000
> was never laid out with a plan, the wood-frame houses were built in a
> hit-and-miss pattern.

I find this fascinating and hard to imagine.

Further update: After finding the [Post Office Reports of Site
Locations](https://www.archives.gov/research/post-offices/locations-1837-1950.html#minnesota)
at the National Archives, I was able to locate most of the post offices by
looking at the requests to establish each post office. Each lists the proposed
location in terms of township, range, section, and corner. Below is a map. I
may improve the map at some point, but I am mostly glad to have located most of
the post offices. What I learned is that most of the ephemeral post offices
opened in the more agricultural southwest part of the county, and that these
post offices in particular seem to have closed soon after the establishment of
free rural mail delivery. While determining the latitude and longitude
associated with each location for mapping, it became clear that many of the
post offices were just farmhouses. Some of which are still standing. I love
this.
