From Justin E. H. Smith's *The Internet Is Not What You Think It Is*:

> Leibniz, for his part, was operating under no such illusions as to the nature
> of the machine he was seeking to build. In a 1685 text entitled "An
> Arithmetical Machine in which Not Only Addition and Subtraction But Also
> Multiplication and Division Are Carried Out with Virtually No Effort of the
> Mind," Leibniz plainly envisions his device not as something that will think,
> or that will involve the labor of an artificial mind rather than of a natural
> one. On the contrary, the machine will free the human mind so it may devote
> itself more fully to true and proper thinking—which is to say reflection,
> meditation, introspection, and the like—rather than being occupied with mere
> computation, which the mind can do too, but which may also be done by systems
> that are not minds. Leibniz explains the benefit of such outsourcing: "[I]t
> is unworthy of excellent men to lose hours like slaves in the labor of
> calculation, which could be safely relegated to anyone else if the machine
> were used."

I imagine Leibniz, wracking his brain with calculation, speaks out of desire
for relief (for narcosis, as McLuhan might say), and might have something
different to say if he were given a Texas Instruments calculator from three
hundred years in the future. Would he ever say "You know, I might prefer to
calculate this myself?" Surely he'd get there when faced with tomorrow's AI,
which would take too much of the thinking from him. Smith may say the AI isn't
thinking, and I agree here, but of course it enables the offloading of more and
more thinking. How carefully and jealously does excellent man guard his
thinking?

I suppose I might agree with what Leibniz wrote here when thinking about my own
relationship with mathematics: It's been aided by calculators and symbolic
algebra software the entire way. I'd rather offload simple arithmetic, and I
can't do anything but the most basic integration for the life of me. At
different times I've wanted to be able to remember random integration rules and
tricks. No longer, thankfully.
