Job Davies, eighty-five  
Winters old, and still alive  
After the slow poison  
And treachery of the seasons.  
  
Miserable? Kick my arse!  
It needs more than the rain's hearse,  
Wind-drawn to pull me off  
The great perch of my laugh.  
  
What's living but courage?  
Paunch full of hot porridge  
Nerves strengthened with tea,  
Peat-black, dawn found me  
  
Mowing where the grass grew,  
Bearded with golden dew.  
Rhythm of the long scythe  
Kept this tall frame lithe  
  
What to do? Stay green.  
Never mind the machine,  
Whose fuel is human souls  
Live large, man, and dream small.
