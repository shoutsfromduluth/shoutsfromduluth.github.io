You could say this poem by Elizabeth Bishop motivates this website.

Alone on the railroad track  
I walked with pounding heart.  
The ties were too close together  
or maybe too far apart.  
The scenery was impoverished:  
scrub-pine and oak; beyond  
its mingled gray-green foliage  
I saw the little pond  
where the dirty old hermit lives,  
lie like an old tear  
holding onto its injuries  
lucidly year after year.  
The hermit shot off his shot-gun  
and the tree by his cabin shook.  
Over the pond went a ripple  
The pet hen went chook-chook.  
"Love should be put into action!"  
screamed the old hermit.  
Across the pond an echo  
tried and tried to confirm it.
