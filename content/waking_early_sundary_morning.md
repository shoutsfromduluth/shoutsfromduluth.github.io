Oh to break loose, like the chinook  
salmon jumping and falling back,  
nosing up to the impossible  
stone and bone-crushing waterfall—  
raw-jawed, weak fleshed there, stopped by ten  
steps of the roaring ladder, and then  
to clear the top on the last try,  
alive enough to spawn and die.  

Stop, back off. The salmon breaks  
water, and now my body wakes  
to feel the unpolluted joy  
and criminal leisure of a boy—  
no rainbow smashing a dry fly  
in the white run is free as I,  
here squatting like a dragon on  
time’s hoard before the day’s begun!  

Time to grub up and junk the year’s  
output, a dead wood of dry verse:  
dim confession, coy revelation,  
liftings, listless self-imitation,  
whole days when I could hardly speak,  
came pluming home unshaven, weak  
and willing to read anyone  
things done before and better done.  

Fierce, fireless mind, running down hill.  
Look up and see the harbor fill:  
business as usual in eclipse  
goes down to the sea in ships—  
wake of refuse, dacron rope,  
bound for Bermuda or Good Hope,  
all bright before the morning watch,  
the wine dark hulls of yawl and ketch.  

I watch a glass of water wet  
with a fine fuzz of icy sweat,  
silvery colors touched with sky,  
serene in their neutrality—  
yet if I shift, or change my mood,  
I see some object made of wood,  
background behind it of brown grain,  
to darken it, but not to stain.  

Oh that the spirit could remain  
tinged but untarnished by its strain!  
Better dressed and stacking birch,  
or lost with the Faithful at Church—  
Oh anywhere, but somewhere else!  
And now the new electric bells,  
clearly chiming, “Faith of our fathers,”  
and now the congregation gathers.  

Oh Bible chopped and crucified  
in hymns we hear but do not read,  
none of the milder subtleties  
of grace or art will sweeten these  
stiff quatrains shovelled out four-square—  
they sing of peace, and preach despair;  
yet they gave darkness their control,  
and left a loophole for the soul.  

No, put old clothes on, and explore  
the corners of the woodshed for  
its dregs and dreck: tools with no handle,  
ten candle-ends not worth a candle,  
old lumber banished from the Temple,  
damned by Paul’s precept and example,  
cast from the kingdom, banned in Israel,  
the wordless sign, the tinkling cymbal.  

Empty, irresolute, ashamed,  
when the sacred texts are named,  
I lie here on my bed apart,  
and when I look into my heart,  
I discover none of the great  
subjects: death, friendship, love and hate—  
only old china doorknobs, sad,  
slight, useless things to calm the mad.  

Oh to break loose now. All life’s grandeur  
is something with a girl in summer…  
elated as the President  
girdled by his establishment  
this Sunday morning, free to chaff  
his own thoughts with his bear-cuffed staff,  
swimming nude, unbuttoned, sick  
of his ghost-written rhetoric!  

No weekends for the gods now, Wars  
flicker, earth licks its open sores,  
fresh breakage, fresh promotions, chance  
assassinations, no advance.  
Only man thinning out his kind  
sounds through the Sabbath noon, the blind  
swipe of the pruner and his knife  
busy about the tree of life.  

Oh hammering military splendor,  
top-heavy Goliath in full armor—  
little redemption in the mass  
liquidations of their brass,  
elephant and phalanx moving  
with the times and still improving,  
when that kingdom hit the crash:  
a million foreskins stacked like trash…  

Sing softer! But what if the new  
diminuendo brings no true  
tenderness, only restlessness,  
excess, the hunger for success,  
sanity of self-deception  
fixed and kicked by reckless caution,  
while I listen to the bells—  
Oh anywhere, but somewhere else!  

Pity the planet, all joy gone  
from this sweet volcanic cone;  
peace to our children when they fall  
in small war on the heels of small  
war—until the end of time  
to police the earth, a ghost  
orbiting forever lost  
in our monotonous sublime.
