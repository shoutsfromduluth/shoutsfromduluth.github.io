Besides being happy to find lupines in Duluth, upon moving here we were also
happy to find thimbleberries, which we found to be great trail snacks out west.
The Latin name is *Rubus parviflorus*, which has stuck with me because *parvi-*
means poor or impoverished, and this bramble has one of the largest flowers in
the *Rubus* genus. Today I thought to look into why this is.

*Rubus parviflorus* was named by Thomas Nuttal from a sample taken from Mackinac
Island in 1810. See the screenshots from his [*The genera of North American
plants, and a catalogue of the species, to the year
1817*](https://archive.org/details/mobot31753002739768/page/309/mode/2up)

Sure enough, he says "flowers small." Okay.

Except [other
sources](https://www.swcoloradowildflowers.com/White%20Enlarged%20Photo%20Pages/rubus.htm)
claim that it was actually Meriwether Lewis that first collected the species
for botanical description in 1806, and that *Rubus parviflorus* was already
taken for a European *Rubus* species in 1770, so it's actually Jose MociÃ±o that
gets to name it *Rubus nutkanus*, after Nootka Island in Vancouver where he
collected it on a Spanish botanical expedition. But then see this note:

> NOTE: When I checked the authoritative Flora of North America in December of

Indeed the Flora of North America [makes no
mention](https://floranorthamerica.org/Rubus_parviflorus) of *R. nutkanus*. I
like *parviflorus* because of the flower size inaccuracy.

The flora says

>  The Great Lakes populations are disjunct from western mountain populations
>  by around 600 miles.

I'd like to know more about this biogeography. Why here?

Also, why do they flower and bear fruit some years but not others?

Update: the biogeography of *R. parviflorus* seems to be similar to the Western
North American - Great Lakes disjunction described in [this
paper](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/721653?journalCode=ijps),
although clearly *R. parviflorus* doesn't match the pattern of being a
*threatened* relict population. I will read more from [this
paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/org/science/article/abs/pii/S1058589322000268).
