By George Herbert

Ah, my dear angry Lord,  
Since thou dost love, yet strike;  
Cast down, yet help afford;  
Sure I will do the like.  
  
I will complain, yet praise;  
I will bewail, approve;  
And all my sour-sweet days  
I will lament and love.

From Ezra Klein's podcast with Mark Epstein:

> In that book, I quoted the poet Anne Carson, who has a beautiful book called
> “Eros the Bittersweet,” where she quotes Sappho. Carson is a scholar of
> ancient Greek, and she says the Greek word for “bittersweet” is actually
> “sweetbitter,” that it’s turned around in English. The sweetness comes first,
> but then, because there’s always a little bit of a letdown, that’s where the
> bitterness is.
>
> The Buddha, in his teachings, was actually saying that gap is interesting.
> And that, if instead of turning away or getting angry or getting frustrated
> or trying to squeeze more out of the object of desire, if instead we can
> settle our minds into that gap with less judgment, there’s an important
> lesson there that will help us with old age, illness, death and any other
> tragedies that are going to befall us.
