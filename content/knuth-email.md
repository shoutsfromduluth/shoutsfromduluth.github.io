A [message](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/email.html) from Donald Knuth:

> I have been a happy man ever since January 1, 1990, when I no longer had an
> email address. I'd used email since about 1975, and it seems to me that 15
> years of email is plenty for one lifetime.
> 
> Email is a wonderful thing for people whose role in life is to be on top of
> things. But not for me; my role is to be on the bottom of things.
