Ten thousand Fords are idle here in search  
Of a tradition. Over these dry sticks—  
The Minute Man, the Irish Catholics,  
The ruined bridge and Walden’s fished-out perch  
The belfry of the Unitarian Church  
Rings out the hanging Jesus. Crucifix,  
How can your whited spindling arms transfix  
Mammon’s unbridled industry, the lurch  
For forms to harness Heraclitus’ stream!  
This Church is Concord—Concord where Thoreau  
Named all the birds without a gun to probe  
Through darkness to the painted man and bow:  
The death-dance of King Philip and his scream  
Whose echo girdled this imperfect globe.
