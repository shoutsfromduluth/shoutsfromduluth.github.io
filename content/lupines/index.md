Lupines, big-leafed lupine, *Lupinus polyphyllus*, supposedly pronounced
"LEW-pin" but everyone I know says "LEW-pine".
[Apparently](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/lupin#English) named for a
fang-like structure in the inner flower but I had heard that they were
previously used to poison wolves.

I've [just learned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupinus_polyphyllus) that the
lupines of Minnesota's North Shore are invasive. Having recently moved here
from the West where *Lupinus* is native and diverse, I was happy to see the big
purple and pink masts in the ditches and puzzled over why they should exist out
west and here but nowhere in between. Now I know that they were brought here as
ornamentals and escaped into the margins.

Around Duluth I've not heard anyone talk of eradication, only appreciation.
We'll be transplanting some into our gardens this summer.

On a ride the other day I snapped this photo, the first lupine of the year.
