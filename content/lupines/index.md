Lupines, big-leafed lupine, *Lupinus polyphyllus*, supposedly pronounced
"LEW-pin" but everyone I know says "LEW-pine".
[Apparently](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/lupin#English) named for a
fang-like structure in the inner flower. I think I read that they were once
used to poison wolves.

I've [just
learned](https://www.minnesotawildflowers.info/flower/large-leaved-lupine) that
the lupines of Minnesota's north shore are invasive. ("ERADICATE!") Having
recently moved here from the western U.S. where *Lupinus* is native and
diverse, I was happy to see the big purple and pink masts in the ditches and
puzzled over why they should exist out west and here but nowhere in between.
Now I know that they were brought here as ornamentals and escaped into the
margins.

Around Duluth I've not heard anyone talk of eradication, only appreciation.
We'll be planting some in our garden this year.

On a ride the other day I snapped this photo, the first lupine of the year.

I'll keep my eye out for *Lupinus perennis*, the local native lupine.
