Lupines, big-leafed lupine, *Lupinus polyphyllus*, supposedly pronounced
"LEW-pin" but everyone I know says "LEW-pine".
[Apparently](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/lupin#English) named for a
fang-like structure in the inner flower. I once read that they were once used
to poison wolves.

I've [just
learned](https://www.minnesotawildflowers.info/flower/large-leaved-lupine) that
the lupines of Minnesota's north shore are invasive ("ERADICATE!").
Having recently moved here from the West where *Lupinus* is native and diverse,
I was happy to see the big purple and pink masts in the ditches and puzzled
over why they should exist out west and here but nowhere in between. Now I know
that they were brought here as ornamentals and escaped into the margins.

Around Duluth I've not heard anyone talk of eradication, only appreciation.
We'll be planting some in our garden this year.

On a ride the other day I snapped this photo, the first lupine of the year.
