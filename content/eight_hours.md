I'm reading [How to Do
Nothing](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/600671/how-to-do-nothing-by-jenny-odell/)
by Jenny O'Dell. It has lots of things to like, like this song from the
Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions:

<em>

We mean to make things over;  
we're tired of toil for naught  
but bare enough to live on:  
never an hour for thought.  
  
We want to feel the sunshine;  
we want to smell the flowers;  
We're sure that God has willed it,  
and we mean to have eight hours.  
  
We're summoning our forces  
from shipyard, shop and mill:  
Eight hours for work, eight hours for rest,  
eight hours for what we will!  

</em>
